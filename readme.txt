This file describes the requirements and sequence to carry out the robotic process of the UiPath application for successful application

Name of folder: RPA_grp2-main

Number of contents: 5 files (Excluding default files, e.g., project.json, default UiPath files)

---------------------------------------------------------------

== Description ==

This project was done to reduce the manual labour and time needed for the Talent Agency to act as a middle-man for companies seeking to hire new applicants, the current process (As-is process) created by the Talent Agency includes manually inputting of data and handling of decision making processes (E.g., checking for new or existing company) therefore costing valuable time and man-power for the agency which affects its efficiency. 

The UiPath robots were created to reduce manual labour and the time required to carry out the tasks by utilizing the automation of processes which was done manually before, this would greatly boost the efficiency of the Talent Agency. 

== Steps ==

Unzip the "RPA_grp2-main" folder once downloaded, the path/location of the folder will not matter (absolute path applied). The UiPath robots are to be run in a specific sequence in order to carry out the application of the steps needed for the task, no changes are required to run the robots.

The sequence is as follows:


1. Insert Company and TAF into Database.xaml
2. RPA_Insert_Resume_details.xaml
3. Shortlist Candidates.xaml
4. Email Candidates Regarding Job Offer.xaml

Upon each completion of the UiPath robot, a "Database1.xaml" file will be updated and available for the user to view. The file can also be opened and observed upon completion of each seperate robot.
